# PowerBI_dashBoard_swiggy

This repository features a Power BI dashboard built for analyzing Zomato's sales data. The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators, including total sales, product category performance, and top-performing cities. It presents insights in a visually appealing and interactive manner, making it easy to explore data trends and draw actionable conclusions.

The dashboard highlights essential metrics, such as total sales amount (987M), quantity sold (2M), ratings (150K), and orders (150K). It includes a detailed breakdown of sales across product categories, with Non-Veg items generating 106M in sales, Veg items contributing 122M, and Others accounting for 24M. Ratings for each category are also displayed to emphasize customer feedback.

An interactive bar chart showcases the top-performing cities, enabling users to filter results for the top 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 cities. Additionally, a line chart illustrates sales trends over the years, providing a clear view of performance from 2017 to 2020.

This project was developed using Power BI and is based on hypothetical Zomato sales data. It serves as a robust tool for data exploration and decision-making. Users can clone the repository, open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop, and interact with the visuals and filters to gain deeper insights. Future enhancements may include integrating real-time data, expanding the analysis to cover more cities, and exploring a broader time frame for sales trends.

This dashboard is ideal for showcasing data visualization skills and offers valuable insights for business analysis.
